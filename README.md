# Water-Systems-Designer - GOAL 6 Clean Water and Sanitization (GDSC)
Without a plan for designing better infrastructure and management for water systems, millions of people will continue to die every year from water-related diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea, and there will be further losses in biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.
To address this proble we propose a Water-Systems-Designer.

This solution helps various communities identify multiple water sources in their locality, realize the directions to these water sources and provides sanity evaluation on the water sources. 
In addition , the system proposes pipeline connections between various water sources and populated localities.
The system can also identify the quantity of infrastructure needed to distribute water from a specific water source. @Forchapeatl , @tawahpeggy and @forchaglen .Working code on JSFiddle [https://jsfiddle.net/forcha/b31am2sx/305/show](https://jsfiddle.net/forcha/b31am2sx/305/show)
